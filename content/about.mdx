### About me

I'm a software engineer working out of Houston, TX, and excited about the possibilities of building 
things with code!

I graduated from the 
[University of Pennsylvania](https://seas.upenn.edu), where I studied
CS and Linguistics. I started coding for [my robotics team](https://www.moe365.net/) in high school
and liked it so much I decided pursue a career down that path.

My past experience is quite broad, but I have the most experience with full-stack web development â€“ 
I do it every day at my current role and have done a great deal of web projects for school, 
internships, and fun. 
I also enjoy working in lower-level areas, as I was a TA for three computer systems classes
([Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/current/), 
[Operating Systems](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/about/teaching/cis548/),
and [Computer Organization & Design](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5710/current/)). I've
done research with 
the SemAnTICA Lab from DBEI at Perelman School of Medicine and
the [Architecture and Compilers Group](https://acg.cis.upenn.edu/wiki/).

In addition to coding, I also love to [lion dance](https://youtu.be/KFxgP9slJC4)
and was a longtime member and former president of [Penn's team](https://pennlions.net).
