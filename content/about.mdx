### About me

I'm currently a fourth-year at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://seas.upenn.edu) studying
CS and Linguistics. I started coding for [my high school robotics team](https://www.moe365.net/)
and haven't stopped. My experience is quite broad, but I've gained the most experience 
with web development, having worked two internships at Meta and having been the head of development 
for the [PennApps](https://pennapps.com) Organizing Team. I was also a TA for 
[Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/current/)
and am currently a TA for [Operating Systems](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/about/teaching/cis548/).

My free time is taken up by [lion dance](https://youtu.be/UsxXzYhDG4c) with
[my school's team](https://pennlions.net), of which I am currently president.
