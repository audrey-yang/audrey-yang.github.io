### About me

I'm a recent graduate of the [University of Pennsylvania](https://seas.upenn.edu), where I studied
CS and Linguistics. I started coding for [my robotics team](https://www.moe365.net/) in high school
and liked it so much I decided to study CS in college. 

My experience is quite broad, but I've gained the most experience with web development, 
having worked two internships at Meta and having been the head of development 
for the [PennApps](https://pennapps.com) Organizing Team. I also enjoy working in
lower-level areas, as I was a TA for three computer systems classes
([Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/current/), 
[Operating Systems](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/about/teaching/cis548/),
and [Computer Organization & Design](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5710/current/)). I'm 
currently doing research in the [Architecture and Compilers Group](https://acg.cis.upenn.edu/wiki/)
and will start work as a software engineer at SLB in the fall.

In addition to coding, I also love to [lion dance](https://youtu.be/KFxgP9slJC4)
and was a longtime member and former president of [my school's team](https://pennlions.net).
