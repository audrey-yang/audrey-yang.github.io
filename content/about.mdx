### About me

I'm a software engineer at SLB in Houston, TX, exploring the possibilities
of the cloud within the energy industry.

I graduated from the 
[University of Pennsylvania](https://seas.upenn.edu), where I studied
CS and Linguistics. I started coding for [my robotics team](https://www.moe365.net/) in high school
and liked it so much I decided pursue a career down that path.

My past experience is quite broad, but I have the most experience with web development, 
having worked two internships at Meta and having been the head of development 
for the [PennApps](https://pennapps.com) Organizing Team. I also enjoy working in
lower-level areas, as I was a TA for three computer systems classes
([Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis2400/current/), 
[Operating Systems](https://boonloo.cis.upenn.edu/about/teaching/cis548/),
and [Computer Organization & Design](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5710/current/)). I've
done research with 
the SemAnTICA Lab from DBEI at Perelman School of Medicine and
the [Architecture and Compilers Group](https://acg.cis.upenn.edu/wiki/).

In addition to coding, I also love to [lion dance](https://youtu.be/KFxgP9slJC4)
and was a longtime member and former president of [Penn's team](https://pennlions.net).
