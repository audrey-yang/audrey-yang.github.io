### Summary

I'm a software engineer based in Houston, TX, and excited about the possibilities of building 
things with code!

In my current position, I bring scientific computations to the edge and the cloud, optimizing
engines for each platform and developing pleasant user experiences for visualizing the data.
I am open to new roles in which I can solve interesting problems and expand my skillset as
a software engineer.
